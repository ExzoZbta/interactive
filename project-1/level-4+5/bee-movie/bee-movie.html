                <b>NARRATOR</b>:
    (Black screen with text; The sound of buzzing bees can be heard)
    According to all known laws
    of aviation,
    
    there is no way a bee
    should be able to fly.
    
    Its wings are too small to get
    its fat little body off the ground.


    The bee, of course, flies anyway


    because bees don't care
    what humans think is impossible.

    <b>ADAM</b>:
    I guess he could have
    just gotten out of the way.
    (The car does a barrel roll on the loop-shaped bridge and lands on the
    highway)

    I love this incorporating
    an amusement park into our regular day.
    </br>

    <br>
    <b>BARRY</b>:
    I guess that's why they say we don't need vacations.
    (Barry parallel parks the car and together they fly over the graduating
    students)
    Boy, quite a bit of pomp...
    under the circumstances.
    (Barry and Adam sit down and put on their hats)

    - Well, Adam, today we are men.

    loaded into the buses)

    Heads up! Here we go.
    </br>

    <br>
    <b>ANNOUNCER</b>:
    Keep your hands and antennas
    inside the tram at all times.
    </br>

    <br>
    <b>BARRY</b>:
    - Wonder what it'll be like?
    </br>

    <br>
    <b>ADAM</b>:
    - A little scary.
    </br>

    <br>
    <b>TOUR GUIDE</b>:
    Welcome to Honex,
    a division of Honesco

    and a part of the Hexagon Group.

    <br>
    <b>BARRY</b>:
    This is it!
    </br>

    <br>
    <b>BARRY AND ADAM</b>:
    Wow.
    </br>

    <br>
    <b>BARRY</b>:
    Wow.
    (The bus drives down a road an on either side are the Bee's massive
    complicated Honey-making machines)
    </br>

    <br>
    <b>TOUR GUIDE</b>:
    We know that you, as a bee,
    have worked your whole life

    to get to the point where you
    can work for your whole life.

    Honey begins when our valiant Pollen
    Jocks bring the nectar to the hive.

    Our top-secret formula

    is automatically color-corrected,

    scent-adjusted and bubble-contoured

    into this soothing sweet syrup

    with its distinctive
    golden glow you know as...
    </br>

    <br>
    <b>EVERYONE ON BUS</b>:
    Honey!
    (The guide has been collecting honey into a bottle and she throws it into
    the crowd on the bus and it is caught by a girl in the back)
    </br>

    <br>
    <b>ADAM</b>:
    - That girl was hot.
    </br>

    <br>
    <b>BARRY</b>:
    - She's my cousin!
    </br>

    </br>
    <b>ADAM</b>:
    - She is?
    </br>

    <br>
    <b>BARRY</b>:
    - Yes, we're all cousins.
    </br>

    <br>
    <b>ADAM</b>:
    - Right. You're right.
    </br>

    <br>
    <b>TOUR GUIDE</b>:
    - At Honex, we constantly strive

    to improve every aspect
    of bee existence.

    These bees are stress-testing
    a new helmet technology.
    (The bus passes by a Bee wearing a helmet who is being smashed into the
    ground with fly-swatters, newspapers and boots. He lifts a thumbs up but
    you can hear him groan)
    </br>

    <br>
    <b>ADAM</b>:

    - What do you think he makes?
    </br>

    <br>
    <b>BARRY</b>:
    - Not enough.
    </br>

    <br>
    <b>TOUR GUIDE</b>:
    Here we have our latest advancement,
    the Krelman.
    (They pass by a turning wheel with Bees standing on pegs, who are each
    wearing a finger-shaped hat)
    </br>

    <br>
    <b>BARRY</b>:
    - Wow, What does that do?
    </br>

    <br>
    <b>TOUR GUIDE</b>:
    - Catches that little strand of honey

    that hangs after you pour it.
    Saves us millions.
    </br>

    <br>
    <b>ADAM</b>:
    (Intrigued)
    Can anyone work on the Krelman?
    </br>

    <br>
    <b>TOUR GUIDE</b>:
    Of course. Most bee jobs are
    small ones.
    But bees know that every small job,
    if it's done well, means a lot.

    But choose carefully

    because you'll stay in the job
    you pick for the rest of your life.
    (Everyone claps except for Barry)
    </br>

    <br>
    <b>BARRY</b>:
    The same job the rest of your life?
    I didn't know that.
    </br>

    <br>
    <b>ADAM</b>:

    What's the difference?
    </br>

    <br>
    <b>TOUR GUIDE</b>:
    You'll be happy to know that bees,
    as a species, haven't had one day off

    in 27 million years.
    </br>

    <br>
    <b>BARRY</b>:
    (Upset)
    So you'll just work us to death?

    We'll sure try.
    (Everyone on the bus laughs except Barry. Barry and Adam are walking back
    home together)
    </br>

    <br>
    <b>ADAM</b>:
    Wow! That blew my mind!
    </br>

    <br>
    <b>BARRY</b>:
    "What's the difference?"
    How can you say that?

    One job forever?
    That's an insane choice to have to make.
    </br>

    <br>
    <b>ADAM</b>:
    I'm relieved. Now we only have
    to make one decision in life.
    </br>

    <br>
    <b>BARRY</b>:
    But, Adam, how could they
    never have told us that?
    </br>

    <br>
    <b>ADAM</b>:
    Why would you question anything?
    We're bees.

    We're the most perfectly
    functioning society on Earth.
    </br>

    <br>
    <b>BARRY</b>:
    You ever think maybe things
    work a little too well here?
    </br>

    <br>
    <b>ADAM</b>:
    Like what? Give me one example.
    (Barry and Adam stop walking and it is revealed to the audience that
    hundreds of cars are speeding by and narrowly missing them in perfect
    unison)
    </br>

    <br>
    <b>BARRY</b>:
    I don't know. But you know
    what I'm talking about.
    </br>

    <br>
    <b>ANNOUNCER</b>:
    Please clear the gate.
    Royal Nectar Force on approach.
    </br>

    <br>
    <b>BARRY</b>:
    Wait a second. Check it out.
    (The Pollen jocks fly in, circle around and landing in line)

    - Hey, those are Pollen Jocks!
    </br>

    <br>
    <b>ADAM</b>:
    - Wow.

    I've never seen them this close.
    </br>

    <br>
    <b>BARRY</b>:
    They know what it's like
    outside the hive.
    </br>

    <br>
    <b>ADAM</b>:
    Yeah, but some don't come back.
    </br>

    <br>
    <b>GIRL BEES</b>:
    - Hey, Jocks!
    - Hi, Jocks!
    (The Pollen Jocks hook up their backpacks to machines that pump the nectar
    to trucks, which drive away)
    </br>

    <br>
    <b>LOU LO DUVA</b>:
    You guys did great!

    You're monsters!
    You're sky freaks!
    I love it!
    (Punching the Pollen Jocks in joy)
    I love it!
    </br>

    <br>
    <b>ADAM</b>:
    - I wonder where they were.
    </br>

    <br>
    <b>BARRY</b>:
    - I don't know.

    Their day's not planned.

    Outside the hive, flying who knows
    where, doing who knows what.

    You can't just decide to be a Pollen
    Jock. You have to be bred for that.
    </br>

    <br>
    <b>ADAM</b>:
    Right.
    (Barry and Adam are covered in some pollen that floated off of the Pollen
    Jocks)
    </br>

    <br>
    <b>BARRY</b>:
    Look at that. That's more pollen
    than you and I will see in a lifetime.
    </br>

    <br>
    <b>ADAM</b>:
    It's just a status symbol.
    Bees make too much of it.
    </br>

    <br>
    <b>BARRY</b>:
    Perhaps. Unless you're wearing it
    and the ladies see you wearing it.
    (Barry waves at 2 girls standing a little away from them)
    </br>

    <br>
    <b>ADAM</b>:
    Those ladies?
    Aren't they our cousins too?
    </br>

    <br>
    <b>BARRY</b>:
    Distant. Distant.
    </br>

    <br>
    <b>POLLEN JOCK #1</b>:
    Look at these two.
    </br>

    <br>
    <b>POLLEN JOCK #2</b>:
    - Couple of Hive Harrys.
    </br>

    <br>
    <b>POLLEN JOCK #1</b>:
    - Let's have fun with them.
    <br>

    <br>
    <b>GIRL BEE #1</b>:
    It must be dangerous
    being a Pollen Jock.
    </br>

    <br>
    <b>BARRY</b>:
    Yeah. Once a bear pinned me
    against a mushroom!

    He had a paw on my throat,
    and with the other, he was slapping me!
    (Slaps Adam with his hand to represent his scenario)
    </br>

    <br>
    <b>GIRL BEE #2</b>:
    - Oh, my!
    </br>

    <br>
    <b>BARRY</b>:
    - I never thought I'd knock him out.
    </br>

    <br>
    <b>GIRL BEE #1</b>:
    (Looking at Adam)
    What were you doing during this?
    </br>

    <br>
    <b>ADAM</b>:
    Obviously I was trying to alert the authorities.
    </br>

    <br>
    <b>BARRY</b>:
    I can autograph that.

    (The pollen jocks walk up to Barry and Adam, they pretend that Barry and
    Adam really are pollen jocks.)
    </br>

    <br>
    <b>POLLEN JOCK #1</b>:
    A little gusty out there today,
    wasn't it, comrades?
    </br>

    <br>
    <b>BARRY</b>:
    Yeah. Gusty.
    </br>

    <br>
    <b>POLLEN JOCK #1</b>:
    We're hitting a sunflower patch
    six miles from here tomorrow.
    </br>

    <br>

    - Six miles, huh?
    </br>

    <br>
    <b>ADAM</b>:
    - Barry!
    </br>

    <br>
    <b>POLLEN JOCK #2</b>:
    A puddle jump for us,
    but maybe you're not up for it.
    </br>

    <br>
    <b>BARRY</b>:
    - Maybe I am.
    </br>

    <br>

    - You are not!
    </br>

    <br>
    <b>POLLEN JOCK #1</b>:

    What do you think, buzzy-boy?
    Are you bee enough?

    Hey, Honey!
    <b>BARRY</b>:
    Dad, you surprised me.
    </br>

    <br>
    <b>MARTIN</b>:
    You decide what you're interested in?
    </br>

    <br>
    <b>BARRY</b>:
    - Well, there's a lot of choices.
    - But you only get one.

    Do you ever get bored
    doing the same job every day?
    </br>

    <br>
    <b>MARTIN</b>:
    Son, let me tell you about stirring.

    You grab that stick, and you just
    move it around, and you stir it around.

    You get yourself into a rhythm.
    It's a beautiful thing.
    </br>

    <br>
    <b>BARRY</b>:
    You know, Dad,
    the more I think about it,

    maybe the honey field
    just isn't right for me.
    </br>

    <br>
    <b>MARTIN</b>:
    You were thinking of what,
    making balloon animals?

    That's a bad job
    for a guy with a stinger.


    Janet, your son's not sure
    he wants to go into honey!

    <b>MARTIN</b>:
    You're not funny! You're going
    into honey. Our son, the stirrer!
    </br>

    <b>JANET</b>:
    - You're gonna be a stirrer?

    <b>MARTIN</b>:
    Wait till you see the sticks I have.
    </br>

    <br>
    <b>BARRY</b>:
    I could say anything right now.
    I'm gonna get an ant tattoo!
    (Barry's parents don't listen to him and continue to ramble on)

    <br>
    <b>MARTIN</b>:
    Let's open some honey and celebrate!
    </br>

    <br>

    </br>

    <br>
    <b>BARRY</b>:
    I just want to say I'm grateful.
    I'll leave now.
    (Barry turns to leave)
    </br>

    <br>
    <b>VANESSA</b>:
    - Wait! How did you learn to do that?
    </br>

    <br>
    <b>BARRY</b>:
    (Flying back)
    - What?
    </br>

    <br>
    <b>VANESSA</b>:
    The talking...thing.
    </br>

    <br>
    <b>BARRY</b>:

    Same way you did, I guess.
    "Mama, Dada, honey." You pick it up.
    </br>

    <br>
    <b>VANESSA</b>:
    - That's very funny.
    </br>

    <br>
    <b>BARRY</b>:
    - Yeah.

    Bees are funny. If we didn't laugh,
    we'd cry with what we have to deal with.

    Anyway...
    </br>

    <br>
    <b>VANESSA</b>:
    Can I...

    ...get you something?
    </br>

    <br>
    <b>BARRY</b>:
    - Like what?
    </br>

    <br>
    <b>VANESSA</b>:
    I don't know. I mean...
    I don't know. Coffee?
    </br>

    <br>
    <b>BARRY</b>:
    I don't want to put you out.
    </br>

    <br>
    <b>VANESSA</b>:
    It's no trouble. It takes two minutes.

    - It's just coffee.
    </br>

    <br>
    <b>BARRY</b>:
    - I hate to impose.
    (Vanessa starts making coffee)
    </br>

    <br>
    <b>VANESSA</b>:
    - Don't be ridiculous!
    </br>

    <br>
    <b>BARRY</b>:
    - Actually, I would love a cup.
    </br>

    <br>
    <b>VANESSA</b>:
    Hey, you want rum cake?
    </br>

    <br>
    <b>BARRY</b>:
    - I shouldn't.
    </br>

    <br>
    <b>VANESSA</b>:
    - Have some.
    </br>

    <br>
    <b>BARRY</b>:
    - No, I can't.
    </br>

    <br>
    <b>VANESSA</b>:
    - Come on!
    </br>

    <br>
    <b>BARRY</b>:
    I'm trying to lose a couple micrograms.
    </br>

    <br>
    <b>VANESSA</b>:
    - Where?
    </br>

    <br>
    <b>BARRY</b>:
    - These stripes don't help.
    </br>

    <br>
    <b>VANESSA</b>:
    You look great!
    </br>

    <br>
    <b>BARRY</b>:
    I don't know if you know
    anything about fashion.

    Are you all right?
    </br>

    <br>
    <b>VANESSA</b>:
    (Pouring coffee on the floor and missing the cup completely)
    No.
    (Flash forward in time. Barry and Vanessa are sitting together at a table
    on top of the apartment building drinking coffee)
    </br>

    <br>
    <b>BARRY</b>:
    He's making the tie in the cab
    as they're flying up Madison.

    He finally gets there.

    He runs up the steps into the church.
    The wedding is on.

    And he says, "Watermelon?
    I thought you said Guatemalan.

    Why would I marry a watermelon?"
    (Barry laughs but Vanessa looks confused)
    </br>

    <br>
    <b>VANESSA</b>:
    Is that a bee joke?
    </br>

    <br>
    <b>BARRY</b>:
    That's the kind of stuff we do.
    </br>

    <br>
    <b>VANESSA</b>:
    Yeah, different.

    So, what are you gonna do, Barry?
    (Barry stands on top of a sugar cube floating in his coffee and paddles it
    around with a straw like it's a gondola)
    </br>

    <br>
    <b>BARRY</b>:
    About work? I don't know.

    I want to do my part for the hive,
    but I can't do it the way they want.
    </br>

    <br>
    <b>VANESSA</b>:
    I know how you feel.
    </br>

    <br>
    <b>BARRY</b>:
    - You do?
    </br>

    <br>
    <b>VANESSA</b>:
    - Sure.

    My parents wanted me to be a lawyer or
    a doctor, but I wanted to be a florist.
    </br>

    <br>
    <b>BARRY</b>:
    - Really?
    <b>VANESSA</b>:
    - My only interest is flowers.
    <b>BARRY</b>:
    Our new queen was just elected
    with that same campaign slogan.

    Anyway, if you look...
    (Barry points to a tree in the middle of Central Park)

    There's my hive right there. See it?
    </br>

    <br>
    <b>VANESSA</b>:
    You're in Sheep Meadow!
    </br>

    <br>
    <b>BARRY</b>:
    Yes! I'm right off the Turtle Pond!
    </br>

    <br>
    <b>VANESSA</b>:
    No way! I know that area.
    I lost a toe ring there once.
    </br>

    <br>
    <b>BARRY</b>:
    - Why do girls put rings on their toes?
    </br>

    <br>
    <b>VANESSA</b>:
    - Why not?
    </br>

    <br>
    <b>BARRY</b>:

    - It's like putting a hat on your knee.
    </br>

    <br>
    <b>VANESSA</b>:
    - Maybe I'll try that.
    (A custodian installing a lightbulb looks over at them but to his
    perspective it looks like Vanessa is talking to a cup of coffee on the
    table)
    </br>

    <br>
    <b>CUSTODIAN</b>:
    - You all right, ma'am?
    </br>

    <br>
    <b>VANESSA</b>:
    - Oh, yeah. Fine.

    Just having two cups of coffee!
    </br>

    <br>
    <b>BARRY</b>:
    Anyway, this has been great.
    Thanks for the coffee.
    </br>

    <br>
    <b>VANESSA</b>:
    Yeah, it's no trouble.
    </br>

    <br>
    <b>BARRY</b>:
    Sorry I couldn't finish it. If I did,
    I'd be up the rest of my life.
    (Barry points towards the rum cake)

    Can I take a piece of this with me?
    </br>

    <br>
    <b>VANESSA</b>:
    Sure! Here, have a crumb.
    (Vanessa hands Barry a crumb but it is still pretty big for Barry)
    </br>

    <br>
    <b>BARRY</b>:
    - Thanks!
    </br>

    <br>
    <b>VANESSA</b>:
    - Yeah.
    </br>

    <br>
    <b>BARRY</b>:
    All right. Well, then...
    I guess I'll see you around.


    Or not.
    </br>

    <br>
    <b>VANESSA</b>:
    OK, Barry...
    </br>

    <br>
    <b>BARRY</b>:
    And thank you
    so much again... for before.
    </br>

    <br>
    <b>VANESSA</b>:
    Oh, that? That was nothing.
    </br>

    <br>
    <b>BARRY</b>:
    Well, not nothing, but... Anyway...
    (Vanessa and Barry hold hands, but Vanessa has to hold out a finger because
    her hands is to big and Barry holds that)
    (The custodian looks over again and it appears Vanessa is laughing at her
    coffee again. The lightbulb that he was screwing in sparks and he falls off
    the ladder)
    (Fast forward in time and we see two Bee Scientists testing out a parachute
    in a Honex wind tunnel)
    </br>

    <br>
    <b>BEE SCIENTIST #1</b>:
    This can't possibly work.
    </br>

    <br>
    <b>BEE SCIENTIST #2</b>:
    He's all set to go.
    We may as well try it.

    OK, Dave, pull the chute.
    (Dave pulls the chute and the wind slams him against the wall and he falls
    on his face.The camera pans over and we see Barry and Adam walking
    together)
    </br>

    <br>
    <b>ADAM</b>:
    - Sounds amazing.
    </br>

    <br>
    <b>BARRY</b>:
    - It was amazing!

    It was the scariest,
    happiest moment of my life.
    </br>

    <br>
    <b>ADAM</b>:
    Humans! I can't believe
    you were with humans!

    Giant, scary humans!
    What were they like?
    </br>

    <br>
    <b>BARRY</b>:
    Huge and crazy. They talk crazy.

    They eat crazy giant things.
    They drive crazy.
    </br>

    <br>
    <b>ADAM</b>:
    - Do they try and kill you, like on TV?
    </br>

    <br>
    <b>BARRY</b>:
    - Some of them. But some of them don't.
    </br>

    <br>
    <b>ADAM</b>:
    - How'd you get back?
    </br>

    <br>
    <b>BARRY</b>:
    - Poodle.
    </br>

    <br>
    <b>ADAM</b>:
    You did it, and I'm glad. You saw
    whatever you wanted to see.

    You had your "experience." Now you
    can pick out your job and be normal.
    </br>

    <br>
    <b>BARRY</b>:
    - Well...
    </br>

    <br>
    <b>ADAM</b>:
    - Well?
    </br>

    <br>
    <b>BARRY</b>:
    Well, I met someone.
    </br>

    <br>
    <b>ADAM</b>:
    You did? Was she Bee-ish?

    - A wasp?! Your parents will kill you!
    </br>

    <br>
    <b>BARRY</b>:
    - No, no, no, not a wasp.
    </br>

    <br>
    <b>ADAM</b>:
    - Spider?
    </br>

    <br>
    <b>BARRY</b>:
    - I'm not attracted to spiders.

    I know, for everyone else, it's the hottest thing,
    with the eight legs and all.

    I can't get by that face.
    </br>

    <br>
    <b>ADAM</b>:
    So who is she?
    </br>

    <br>
    <b>BARRY</b>:
    She's... human.
    </br>

    <br>
    <b>ADAM</b>:
    No, no. That's a bee law.
    You wouldn't break a bee law.
    </br>

    <br>
    <b>BARRY</b>:
    - Her name's Vanessa.
    (Adam puts his head in his hands)
    </br>

    <br>
    <b>ADAM</b>:
    - Oh, boy.
    </br>

    <br>
    <b>BARRY</b>:
    She's so nice. And she's a florist!
    </br>

    <br>
    <b>ADAM</b>:
    Oh, no! You're dating a human florist!
    </br>

    <br>
    <b>BARRY</b>:
    We're not dating.
    </br>

    <br>
    <b>ADAM</b>:
    You're flying outside the hive, talking
    to humans that attack our homes

    with power washers and M-80s!
    That's one-eighth a stick of dynamite!
    </br>

    <br>
    <b>BARRY</b>:
    She saved my life!
    And she understands me.
    </br>

    <br>
    <b>ADAM</b>:
    This is over!
    </br>

    <br>
    <b>BARRY</b>:
    Eat this.
    (Barry gives Adam a piece of the crumb that he got from Vanessa. Adam eats
    it)
    </br>

    <br>
    <b>ADAM</b>:
    (Adam's tone changes)
    This is not over! What was that?
    </br>

    <br>
    <b>BARRY</b>:
    - They call it a crumb.
    </br>

    <br>
    <b>ADAM</b>:
    - It was so stingin' stripey!
    </br>

    <br>
    <b>BARRY</b>:
    And that's not what they eat.
    That's what falls off what they eat!

    - You know what a Cinnabon is?
    </br>

    <br>
    <b>ADAM</b>:
    - No.
    (Adam opens a door behind him and he pulls Barry in)
    </br>

    <br>
    <b>BARRY</b>:
    It's bread and cinnamon and frosting.
    </br>

    <br>
    <b>ADAM</b>:
    Be quiet!
    </br>

    <br>

    We are not them! We're us.
    There's us and there's them!
    </br>

    <br>
    <b>BARRY</b>:
    Yes, but who can deny
    the heart that is yearning?
    </br>

    <br>
    <b>ADAM</b>:
    There's no yearning.
    Stop yearning. Listen to me!

    You have no job. You're barely a bee!

    to make a little honey?

    Your father's talking to you.

    Martin, would you talk to him?
    </br>

    <br>
    <b>MARTIN</b>:

    Barry, I'm talking to you!
    (Barry keeps sinking into the honey until he is suddenly in Central Park
    having a picnic with Vanessa)
    (Barry has a cup of honey and he clinks his glass with Vanessas. Suddenly a
    mosquito lands on Vanessa and she slaps it, killing it. They both gasp but
    then burst out laughing)

    pink smoke from the plane, but on the last loop-the-loop she suddenly
    crashes into a mountain and the plane explodes. The destroyed plane falls
    into some rocks and explodes a second time)

    <br>

    Up on a float, surrounded

    How come you don't fly everywhere?

    So you have to watch your temper
    (They walk into a store)

    You kick a wall, take a walk,

    write an angry letter and throw it out.
    Work through it like any emotion:

    Anger, jealousy, lust.
    (Suddenly an employee(Hector) hits Barry off of Vanessa's shoulder. Hector
    thinks he's saving Vanessa)

    Bees have good qualities.

    And it takes my mind off the shop.

    Instead of flowers, people
    are giving balloon bouquets now.

    your opening statement, please.
    </br>

    <br>
    <b>MONTGOMERY</b>:
    Ladies and gentlemen of the jury,

    my grandmother was a simple woman.


    Born on a farm, she believed
    it was man's divine right

    to benefit from the bounty
    of nature God put before us.

    If we lived in the topsy-turvy world
    Mr. Benson imagines,

    just think of what would it mean.

    I would have to negotiate
    with the silkworm

    for the elastic in my britches!

    Talking bee!
    (Montgomery walks over and looks closely at Barry)

    How do we know this isn't some sort of

    holographic motion-picture-capture
    Hollywood wizardry?

    They could be using laser beams!

    Robotics! Ventriloquism!
    Cloning! For all we know,

    he could be on steroids!
    </br>

    <br>
    <b>JUDGE BUMBLETON</b>:
    Mr. Benson?
    </br>

    <br>
    <b>BARRY</b>:
    Ladies and gentlemen,
    there's no trickery here.

    I'm just an ordinary bee.
    Honey's pretty important to me.

    It's important to all bees.
    We invented it!

    We make it. And we protect it
    with our lives.

    Unfortunately, there are
    some people in this room

    who think they can take it from us

    'cause we're the little guys!
    I'm hoping that, after this is all over,

    you'll see how, by taking our honey,
    you not only take everything we have

    but everything we are!
    </br>

    Yes, they provide beekeepers
    for our farms.
    </br>

    <br>
    <b>BARRY</b>:
    Beekeeper. I find that
    to be a very disturbing term.

    I don't imagine you employ
    any bee-free-ers, do you?
    </br>

    <br>

    <br>
    <b>KLAUSS</b>:
    - No.
    </br>

    <br>
    <b>BARRY</b>:
    - No.

    Because you don't free bees.
    You keep bees. Not only that,

    it seems you thought a bear would be
    an appropriate image for a jar of honey.
    </br>

    roaring and standing on its hind legs. It is thrashing its claws and people
    are screaming. It is being held back by a guard who has the bear on a

    (Pointing to the roaring bear)

    <b>STING</b>:
    No, I haven't.
    </br>

    <br>

    No, you haven't. And so here
    we have yet another example

    of bee culture casually
    stolen by a human

    for nothing more than
    a prance-about stage name.

    you're alive. You could have died.
    </br>

    <br>
    <b>ADAM</b>:
    I'd be better off dead. Look at me.
    (A small plastic sword is replaced as Adam's stinger)
    They got it from the cafeteria

    Well, Your Honor, it's interesting.

    and cough)

    to bees who have never been asked,
    "Smoking or non?"

    Is this what nature intended for us?

    To be forcibly addicted
    to smoke machines

    and man-made wooden slat work camps?

    That's why this is the last parade.
    </br>

    <br>

    <br>

    This is a total disaster, all my fault.

    Yes, it kind of is.
    </br>

    <br>

    I wanted to help you

    <b>VANESSA</b>:
    Actually, it's completely closed down.

    I thought maybe you were remodeling.

    But I have another idea, and it's
    greater than my previous ideas combined.

    <br>
    <b>VANESSA</b>:
    I don't want to hear it!
    </br>

    <br>
    <b>BARRY</b>:
    All right, they have the roses,
    the roses have the pollen.

    I know every bee, plant
    and flower bud in this park.

    All we gotta do is get what they've got
    back here with what we've got.

    - Bees.
    </br>

    <br>
    <b>VANESSA</b>:
    - Park.

    Tournament of Roses,

    They've got nothing
    but flowers, floats and cotton candy.

    Flash forward in time. Vanessa is about to board a plane which has all the

    <br>
    <b>BARRY</b>:
    Once inside,
    we just pick the right float.
    </br>

    <br>
    <b>VANESSA</b>:
    How about The Princess and the Pea?

    I could be the princess,
    and you could be the pea!
    </br>

    <br>

    - Where should I sit?

    <br>
    <b>GUARD</b>:
    - Not in this fairy tale, sweetheart.
    - I'm getting the marshal.
    </br>

    <br>
    <b>VANESSA</b>:
    You do that!
    This whole parade is a fiasco!

    Let's see what this baby'll do.
    (Vanessa drives the float through traffic)
    </br>

    <br>
    <b>GUARD</b>:

    </br>

    <br>
    <b>BARRY</b>:
    Then all we do
    is blend in with traffic...

    ...without arousing suspicion.

    Once at the airport,
    there's no stopping us.
    (Flash forward in time and Barry and Vanessa are about to get on a plane)

    - Yes.
    </br>

    </br>

    <br>
    <b>VANESSA</b>:

    (To Barry)
    - Remove your stinger.

    (Barry plotting with Vanessa)
    </br>

    Then if we're lucky, we'll have
    just enough pollen to do the job.
    (Flash forward in time and Barry and Vanessa are flying on the plane)
    Can you believe how lucky we are? We

    - Who's an attorney?
    </br>

    <br>
    <b>CAPTAIN SCOTT</b>:
    Don't move.
    (Scott hits Hal in the face with the vacuum in an attempt to hit Barry. Hal
    is knocked out and he falls on the life raft button which launches an
    infalatable boat into Scott, who gets knocked out and falls to the floor.
    They are both uncounscious.)

    Would a Miss Vanessa Bloome in 24B
    please report to the cockpit?

    <br>
    <b>BARRY</b>:
    I tried to talk to them, but
    then there was a DustBuster,
    a toupee, a life raft exploded.

    Now one's bald, one's in a boat,
    and they're both unconscious!

    Am I koo-koo-kachoo, or is this plane
    flying in an insect-like pattern?
    (The plane is unrealistically hovering and spinning over the bee-flower)
    </br>

    <br>
    <b>BARRY</b>:
    Get your nose in there. Don't be afraid.
    Smell it. Full reverse!

    Just drop it. Be a part of it.

    Aim for the center!

    Now drop it in! Drop it in, woman!

    Come on, already.
    (The bees scatter and the plane safely lands)
    </br>

    <br>
    <b>VANESSA</b>:
    Barry, we did it!
    You taught me how to fly!
    </br>

    <br>
    <b>BARRY</b>:
    - Yes!
    (Vanessa is about to high-five Barry)
    No high-five!
    </br>

    <br>
    <b>VANESSA</b>:
    - Right.
    </br>

    <br>
    <b>ADAM</b>:
    Barry, it worked!
    Did you see the giant flower?
    </br>

    <br>
    <b>BARRY</b>:
    What giant flower? Where? Of course
    I saw the flower! That was genius!
    </br>

    <br>
    <b>ADAM</b>:
    - Thank you.
    </br>

    <br>
    <b>BARRY</b>:
    - But we're not done yet.

    Listen, everyone!

    This runway is covered
    with the last pollen

    from the last flowers
    available anywhere on Earth.

    That means this is our last chance.

    We're the only ones who make honey,
    pollinate flowers and dress like this.

    If we're gonna survive as a species,
    this is our moment! What do you say?


    Are we going to be bees, or just
    Museum of Natural History keychains?
    </br>

    <br>
    <b>BEES</b>:
    We're bees!
    </br>

    <br>
    <b>BEE WHO LIKES KEYCHAINS</b>:
    Keychain!
    </br>

    <br>
    <b>BARRY</b>:
    Then follow me! Except Keychain.
    </br>

    <br>
    <b>POLLEN JOCK #1</b>:
    Hold on, Barry. Here.

    You've earned this.
    </br>

    <br>
    <b>BARRY</b>:
    Yeah!

    I'm a Pollen Jock! And it's a perfect
    fit. All I gotta do are the sleeves.
    (The Pollen Jocks throw Barry a nectar-collecting gun. Barry catches it)
    Oh, yeah.
    </br>

    <br>
    <b>JANET</b>:
    That's our Barry.
    (Barry and the Pollen Jocks get pollen from the flowers on the plane)
    (Flash forward in time and the Pollen Jocks are flying over NYC)

    (Barry pollinates the flowers in Vanessa's shop and then heads to Central
    Park)
    </br>

    <br>
    <b>BOY IN PARK</b>:
    Mom! The bees are back!
    </br>

    <br>
    <b>ADAM</b>:
    (Putting on his Krelman hat)
    If anybody needs

    to make a call, now's the time.

    I got a feeling we'll be
    working late tonight!
    (The bee honey factories are back up and running)
    (Meanwhile at Vanessa's shop)
    </br>

    <br>
    <b>VANESSA</b>:
    (To customer)
    Here's your change. Have a great
    afternoon! Can I help who's next?

    Would you like some honey with that?
    It is bee-approved. Don't forget these.
    (There is a room in the shop where Barry does legal work for other animals.
    He is currently talking with a Cow)
    </br>

    <br>
    <b>COW</b>:
    Milk, cream, cheese, it's all me.
    And I don't see a nickel!

    Sometimes I just feel
    like a piece of meat!
    </br>

    <br>
    <b>BARRY</b>:
    I had no idea.
    </br>

    <br>
    <b>VANESSA</b>:
    Barry, I'm sorry.
    Have you got a moment?
    </br>

    <br>
    <b>BARRY</b>:
    Would you excuse me?
    My mosquito associate will help you.
    </br>

    <br>
    <b>MOOSEBLOOD</b>:
    Sorry I'm late.
    </br>

    <br>
    <b>COW</b>:
    He's a lawyer too?
    </br>

    <br>
    <b>MOOSEBLOOD</b>:
    Ma'am, I was already a blood-sucking parasite.
    All I needed was a briefcase.
    </br>

    <br>
    <b>VANESSA</b>:
    Have a great afternoon!

    Barry, I just got this huge tulip order,
    and I can't get them anywhere.
    </br>

    <br>
    <b>BARRY</b>:
    No problem, Vannie.
    Just leave it to me.
    </br>

    <br>
    <b>VANESSA</b>:
    You're a lifesaver, Barry.
    Can I help who's next?
    </br>

    <br>
    <b>BARRY</b>:
    All right, scramble, jocks!
    It's time to fly.
    </br>

    <br>
    <b>VANESSA</b>:
    Thank you, Barry!
    (Ken walks by on the sidewalk and sees the "bee-approved honey" in
    Vanessa's shop)
    </br>

    <br>
    <b>KEN</b>:
    That bee is living my life!!
    </br>

    <br>
    <b>ANDY</b>:
    Let it go, Kenny.
    </br>

    <br>
    <b>KEN</b>:
    - When will this nightmare end?!
    </br>

    <br>
    <b>ANDY</b>:
    - Let it all go.
    </br>

    <br>
    <b>BARRY</b>:
    - Beautiful day to fly.
    </br>

    <br>
    <b>POLLEN JOCK</b>:

    - Sure is.
    </br>

    <br>
    <b>BARRY</b>:
    Between you and me,
    I was dying to get out of that office.
    (Barry recreates the scene near the beginning of the movie where he flies
    through the box kite. The movie fades to black and the credits being)
    [--after credits; No scene can be seen but the characters can be heard
    talking over the credits--]
    You have got
    to start thinking bee, my friend!

    - Thinking bee!
    - Me?
    </br>

    <br>
    <b>BARRY</b>:
    (Talking over singer)
    Hold it. Let's just stop
    for a second. Hold it.

    I'm sorry. I'm sorry, everyone.
    Can we stop here?

    Oh, Barry

    </br>

    <br>
    <b>SINGER</b>:
    All right. Take ten, everybody.
    Wrap it up, guys.

    I had virtually no rehearsal for that.
