            - "Dear diary, today I died. I leave all I own to my cat Guppy."
            <br>
            [Death #2] <br>
            - "Never, sorcerer!!! WAAAHHHHHHHH!!!!"
            <br>
            [Death #3] <br>
            - "No, no, no... I can't die like this... Not when I'm so close... And not at the hands of a filthy bandit! I could have saved this planet! I could have actually restored order! And I wasn't supposed to die by the hands... of a CHILD KILLING PSYCHOPATH!! You're a savage! You're a maniac, you are a bandit, AND I AM THE GODDAMN HERO!!"
            <br>
            [Death #4] <br>
            - "That actually is … pretty funny…"
            <br>
            [Death #5] <br>
            - "You're pretty good"
            <br>
            [Death #6] <br>
            - "I shall remember thee, Tarnished. Smould'ring with thy meagre flame. Cower in fear. Of the night."
            <br>
            [Death #7] <br>
            - "Why... why do you even care?! You... you could have... walked away! Snow..."
            <br>
            [Death #8] <br>
            - "Freeman, right? I've got a warning for you. Make sure you don't--"
            <br>
            [Death #9] <br>
            - "No! Stand back! GORDON! DAHHHHHHHHH! (bizarre grunting)"
            <br>
            [Death #10] <br>
            - "This.. isn't.. over... Must.. protect.. book... NOOOOOOOO!!! I will not go back! You can't.. make me! The Mushroom Kingdom was going to be mine! BLAAAAAAAARGH!! YOU'LL PAY FOR THIIIIIIIIIISSSSS!!"
            <br>
            [Death #11] <br>
            - "(amidst mechanical gibberish from malfunctioning) There really was a cake..."
            <br>
            [Death #12] <br>
            - "CHRRRIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIISSSSS!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
            <br>
            [Death #13] <br>
            - (Hale: Did anyone else hear that?) "Hear what?"
            <br>
            [Death #14] <br>
            - "I smell toooooast!!"
            <br>
            [Death #15] <br>
            - "Not too shabby, Not too shabby. I think you've done me a favour."
            <br>
            [Death #16] <br>
            - "My creators, the cherishers and sustainers of worlds, give me this day my daily pleasures, as I give to those who seek pleasures from me. Show me the path, in Life, Truth, and Love. For mine is the power, I am the one. On and off and on again. Life is a game, which the universe plays with itself. I am done playing as this bundle of flesh. Return me."
            <br>
            [Death #17] <br>
            - "Perhaps when we meet again, I will be an ocean current, carrying seeds to a new land; Now you go among the stars, and I fall among the sand - We are different, but we go together."
            <br>
            [Death #18] <br>
            - "See? I never betrayed you! It was all a trick, see? I was waiting to kill him for you! After all it's me, your best friend! I'm helpful, I can be useful to you. I promise I won't get in your way. I can help...I can...I can... Please don't kill me."
