            In our current unparalleled enterprise, refusal to collaborate is simply a refusal to grow -- an insistence on suicide, if you will.

            <p id="lungfish">Did the lungfish refuse to breathe air? <br>It did not.</p>

            It crept forth boldly while its brethren remained in the blackest ocean abyss, with lidless eyes forever staring at the dark, 
                <br>ignorant and doomed despite their eternal vigilance.
            
            <p id="trilobite">Would we model ourselves on the trilobite?</p>
            
            Are all the accomplishments of humanity fated to be nothing more than a layer of broken plastic shards thinly strewn across a fossil bed, sandwiched between the Burgess shale and an eon's worth of mud?

                <p id="cradle">We have outgrown our cradle.</p>
            It is futile to cry for mother's milk, when our true sustenance awaits us among the stars.
