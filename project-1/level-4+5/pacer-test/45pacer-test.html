            The FitnessGramâ„¢ Pacer Test is a multistage aerobic capacity test that progressively gets more difficult as it continues. 
            The 20 meter pacer test will begin in 30 seconds. 
            Line up at the start. 
            <br><br>
            The running speed starts slowly, but gets faster each minute after you hear this signal:
            <br>
            ------ 
            <br>
            [beep]
            <br> 
            ------
            <br>
            A single lap should be completed each time you hear this sound:
            <br> 
            ------
            <Br>
            [ding]
            <br>
            ------
            <br> 
            Remember to run in a straight line, and run as long as possible. 
            The second time you fail to complete a lap before the sound, your test is over. 
            The test will begin on the word start. On your mark, get ready, start.
