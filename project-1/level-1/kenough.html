  [Verse 1]
  <br>
  Doesn't seem to matter what I do
  </br>
  I'm always number two
  <br>
  No one knows how hard I tried, oh-oh, I
</br>
  I have feelings that I can't explain
  <br>
  Drivin' me insane
</br>
  All my life, been so polite
  <br>
  But I'll sleep alone tonight
</br>

  <br></br>

  [Chorus]
  <br>
  'Cause I'm just Ken
</br>
  Anywhere else, I'd be a ten
  <br>
  Is it my destiny to live and die a life of blond fragility?
</br>
  I'm just Ken
  <br>
  Where I see love, she sees a friend
</br>
  What will it take for her to see the man behind the tan and fight for me?

  <br></br>

  [Verse 2]
  <br>
  I wanna know what it's like to love
</br>
  To be the real thing
  <br>
  Is it a crime? Am I not hot when I'm in my feelings?
</br>
  And is my moment finally here, or am I dreaming?
  <br>
  I'm no dreamer
</br>

  <br></br>

  [Bridge]
  <br>
  Can you feel the Ken-ergy?
</br>
  Feels so real, my Ken-ergy
  <br>
  Can you feel the Ken-ergy?
</br>
  Feels so real, my Ken-ergy
  
  <br></br>

  [Chorus]
  <br>
  I'm just Ken
</br>
  Anywhere else, I'd be a ten
  <br>
  Is it my destiny to live and die a life of blond fragility?
</br>
  I'm just Ken
  <br>
  Where I see love, she sees a friend
</br>
  What will it take for her to see the man behind the tan and fight for me?

  <br></br>

  [Outro]
  <br>
  I'm just Ken (And I'm enough)
</br>
  And I'm great at doing stuff
  <br>
  So, hey, check me out, yeah, I'm just Ken
</br>
  My name's Ken (And so am I)
  <br>
  Put that manly hand in mine
</br>
  So, hey, world, check me out, yeah, I'm just Ken
  <br>
  Baby, I'm just Ken
</br>
  (Nobody else, nobody else)

  <br></br>
