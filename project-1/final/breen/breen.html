                In our current unparalleled enterprise, refusal to collaborate is simply a refusal to grow -- an insistence on suicide, if you will.

                <p id="lungfish">Did the lungfish refuse to breathe air? <br>It did not.</p>

                It crept forth boldly while its brethren remained in the blackest ocean abyss, with lidless eyes forever staring at the dark, 
                    <br>ignorant and doomed despite their eternal vigilance.
                
                <p id="trilobite">Would we model ourselves on the trilobite?</p>
                
                Are all the accomplishments of humanity fated to be nothing more than a layer of broken plastic shards thinly strewn across a fossil bed, sandwiched between the Burgess shale and an eon's worth of mud?
                
                In order to be true to our nature, and our destiny, we must aspire to greater things.
                    <p id="cradle">We have outgrown our cradle.</p>
                It is futile to cry for mother's milk, when our true sustenance awaits us among the stars.
