    <p> In our current unparalleled enterprise, refusal to collaborate is simply a refusal to grow -- an insistence on suicide, if you will. </p>
    
    <p id="lungfish">Did the lungfish refuse to breathe air? <br>It did not.</p>

    <p>It crept forth boldly while its brethren remained in the blackest ocean abyss, with lidless eyes forever staring at the dark, 
        <br>ignorant and doomed despite their eternal vigilance.</p>
    
    <p id="trilobite">Would we model ourselves on the trilobite?</p>
    
    <p>Are all the accomplishments of humanity fated to be nothing more than a layer of broken plastic shards thinly strewn across a fossil bed, 
        sandwiched between the Burgess shale and an eon's worth of mud?</p>
    
    <p>In order to be true to our nature, and our destiny, we must aspire to greater things. </p>
        <p id="cradle">We have outgrown our cradle.</p>
    <p>It is futile to cry for mother's milk, when our true sustenance awaits us among the stars.</p>
    </p>
