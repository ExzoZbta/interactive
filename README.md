## [Project-1: Webzine](https://github.com/ExzoZbta/interactive/tree/main/project-1/final)
---
  ### **Prompt**:
   - Design and build an online publication that includes ten or more pages.   At least one entry should come from an offline source, which means you are publishing this text online for the first time. Your zine should be designed for a specific, defined audience.

  ### **Basic Overview**:
   - This 10-page webzine is my personal collection of iconic popular culture media, primarily video games. The user must navigate the webzine via a custom CLI built with JavaScript. The console's appearance is heavily inspired by the original user interface of Steam, a video game digital distribution platform developed by Valve Corporation.

---
  ### **Prompt**:
   - Make a website that is a tool designed for one specific, named person. The important thing is that you identify the needs of this user specifically.

  ### **Basic Overview**:
   - This interactive tool takes on the form of a vintage TV, simulating the experience of watching old movies or TV shows with the taps of a finger or the presses of keyboard keys.
